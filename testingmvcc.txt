====== Functional Test ======

=== Test Case 1 ===


====== Conflict Handling Test ======

=== Test Case 2 ===

1) Goal: Request delay due to potential conflict but succeed after wakeup

 Send request read-write #r1 (subject1, resource1, action1) and read-write #r2 (subject1, resource1, action1). 
 Then #r1 is delayed due to #r2 might read attr that #r1 is going to update.
 Finally #r2 fails because #r1 update the attribute (history) #r2 depends on. 
 At last #r1 wakes up and being restarted because of conflict.

2) Configuration: Workload2 section in config/testmvcc.config. Run bin/startup.sh workload2

3) Log file:


=== Test Case 3 ===

1) Goal: Request failed immediately upon request back from worker

 Send request read-write #r1 (subject1, resource1, action1) and read-only #r2 (subject1, resource2, action1). 
 Then #r1 fails and restarts due to #r2 definitely read attr that #r1 is going to update.

2) Configuration: Workload3 section in config/testmvcc.config. Run bin/startup.sh workload3

3) Log file:


=== Test Case 4 ===

1) Goal: Request delay due to potential conflict but failed after wakeup

 Send request read-write #r1 (subject1, resource1, action1) and read-only #r2 (subject1, resource3, action1). 
 Similar as Case 2, #r1 is delayed due to #r2 might read attr that #r1 is going to update.
 But #r1 restarts because #r2 succeeds and update rts of attr that #r1 is about to update.

2) Configuration: Workload4 section in config/testmvcc.config. Run bin/startup.sh workload4

3) Log file:


=== Test Case 5 ===

1) Goal: Same as Test Case 2 but wrong prediction

 Send request #r1 (subject1, resource3, action1) and #r2 (subject1, resource3, action1). 
 Same as Test Case 2, but intentional make both subject1 and resource3 possible be written.
 Thus Client (Application) makes wrong prediction.

2) Configuration: Workload5 section in config/testmvcc.config. Run bin/startup.sh workload5

3) Log file:


=== Test Case 6 ===

=== Test Case 7 ===

1) Goal: Test starvation prevention mechanism

 Send request read-write #r1 (subject1, resource3, action1) and read-only #r2 (subject2, resource3, action1). 
 Due to wrong prediction made by client, resource3 is being handle by Coordinator-1 first.
 Upon receiving #r2, #r2 delays because read-write request #r1 is not complete.
 After #r1 is done, #r2 continues and succeeds at last.

2) Configuration: Workload6 section in config/testmvcc.config. Run bin/startup.sh workload6
